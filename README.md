# Space-Shooter
Project 2 for MSCH-220
September 27, 2023

A space shooter in the form of a bullet hell game that includes a wave of enemies and a boss. Combining found assets with hand-drawn elements (background and explosion) makes this a game with interesting visuals to add to the gameplay.

## Implementation
The game was developed in Godot.

## What Makes this a Game?
This space shooter is a game because it promotes competence by showing the player their score and enabling them to attempt at achieving the best score they can. It also creates autonomy because the player controls the ship and can choose which ship they want to play with.

## Future Development
In the future, I would like to add sound effects and background music, more enemies, and more weapons.
